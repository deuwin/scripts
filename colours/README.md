# Colours
Scripts to show off how pretty your terminal can be.

## Colour Tables

  - [ANSI escape code - 8-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ANSI_escape_code&oldid=1143439661#8-bit)
  - [Xterm 256 colors and examples](https://robotmoon.com/256-colors/)

## More Colours
256 colours not enough? What about 16 million? 24-bit colour is an option
assuming your terminal supports it and you're willing to jump through any
additional hoops.

## `LS_COLORS`
The `LS_COLORS` environment variable controls how files are displayed through
tools such as `ls`. You can see a sample with [this script](https://github.com/gkotian/gautam_linux/blob/master/scripts/colours.sh).

If you want to customise it you can do so manually or with some other
framework.
